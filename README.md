# bluetooth_alarm
This is a tool to get a beep alarm when device is disconnected from the bluetooth device.

This tool will help you get a beep sound constantly when your device is disconnected from your bluetooth connecction.

Start the code once you have connected to the network.

The code runs in a repeated loop and once bluetooth is disconnected creates noise, so you dont want to bother about unknown disconnection anymore.

Usage:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/GreyHatTor/bluetooth_alarm.git
  cd bluetooth_alarm
  python3 bt2.py
  ```
  Note: Make sure the "beep.wav" file is located in the home folder.
  You can contact the dev regarding any queries...! Happy coding :)
